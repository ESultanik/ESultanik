Evan is a computer security researcher based in Philadelphia working at [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/). 
He has a couple dozen academic publications, but most of them are related to distributed systems and combinatorial optimization,
not security.
He is also an editor of and frequent contributor to the offensive computer security journal [Proof of Concept or GTFO](https://www.sultanik.com/pocorgtfo).
Aside from when writing in a biographical format, Evan does not usually refer to himself in the third person.

A cleanroom, pure-Python implementation of libmagic that can identify files, is smart about polyglots (files that are
multiple types at the same time), can output an interactive HTML-based hex viewer, and recursively enumerate the
contents of a file (similar to `binwalk`).

### A PDF Git Repository Polyglot

I created a [PDF that is a git repository](https://github.com/ESultanik/PDFGitPolyglot) that, when cloned, contains its LaTeX 
source code and a copy of itself. The PDF contains an article describing how I did it.
